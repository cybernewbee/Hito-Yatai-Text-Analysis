2023-11-18,5,"Authentic Japanese! Amazing service and super accommodating to our very young children. We will be regulars here.","Tia S.","Las Vegas, NV",2023-11-01
2023-10-06,5,"Food good, services good, the restaurant is beautiful and chill. This is what sushi eater wants to go. Rare place to find in this area.","Kito T.","San Francisco, CA",2023-10-01
2023-09-02,5,"This is a hidden gem located in Carmichael neighborhood that is just recently opened. Their menu is specially curated with the most freshest fish available by each day so you will see different menu every now and then. When we tried our appetizer, string seaweed from southern side of Japan and sea bream sashimi w/ yuzu jelly, we already knew that we're gonna come back so soon. I was so tired of Mikuni type of American Japanese restaurants that serve sushi rolls drizzled with three different kinds of sweet sauces and fried stuff inside, and you know there are not many authentic Japanese restaurants in Sac area, I was so happy that I found this restaurant!!","Emmanuella O.","CA, CA",2023-09-01
2023-11-19,5,"Easily the most thoughtful and delicious meal I've had in a long time.  The fish was incredibly fresh and the service made me feel right at home.  This is a hidden gem and I would suggest anyone who loves Japanese food to try this place!","Kyler R.","East Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",2023-11-01
2023-08-22,1,"We drove 25 minutes to try this place out.  We wont be coming to this restaurant again. Both the service and the cleanliness of the facility has not improved with nee ownership. A good sushi, restaurant, should not  smell like fish when you first walk in. It appears that the owners made no changes to that. Secondly, we went and waited before the restaurant opened was greeted by the hostess sat down. Waited 20 minutes to be served in an empty restaurant, only for the hostess to wait on the table that came in after us.  It's too bad.  Because my children will prefer sushi over any other food, and we go tp Mikuni at least 6x a month.  I was excited to try a more authentic sushi place.  But this experience has rendered it impossible for us to return here.","Thuy T.","Chico, CA",2023-08-01
2023-08-02,5,"First of all. I've been Chef for over 30 yrs., having studied at The Culinary Institute of America, the top culinary school in the country, and one of the top in the world, where just about every celebrity chef has studied. My specialty is international cuisine, Japanese being in my top 5.  So I have eaten at MANY sushi restaurants in my lifetime.At first, I was skeptical about the place. And knowing it had only been open 3 wks at the time didn't help either.  Boy was I wrong.  In short:Atmosphere: was greeted warmly and sincerely when entered. Very friendly.The restaurant was clean, bright, and tastefully decorated. Felt very ""homey"".Food: The sushi chef/owner, went to great lengths to describe and explain the dishes. The restaurant has an extensive selection of fresh fish, and it all looks fresh and brightly colored. Upon arrival, the dishes were masterfully presented and attractive.  Each dish tasted fresh and flavorful.  Some of the best I've ever had. Price:  I was pleasantly surprised at how reasonable their pricing was.  3 specialty rolls, teriyaki salmon, soup, salad, gyoza, tea & beer for $70, inc. tip.The same meal at one of the local ""more visible"" sushi restaurants, (Mikunis, etc.) would have been 25-30% more.  This is now my go-to place for sushi in Sac.  GREAT JOB!  *Be sure to visit my Chef page: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063574007058","Kevin L.","Walnut Creek, CA",2023-08-01
2023-08-11,5,"Excellent sushi and a nice relaxing dinner. I strongly recommend supporting this family owned business.","Peggy H.","San Jose, CA",2023-08-01
2023-10-30,5,"Love this place. It's a small hole in the wall but the quality of the fish is top notch. The nigiri and sashimi are where they really shine but the appetizer specials are very good too. Okonomiyaki was killer. The guys at the bar are very knowledgeable and are happy to make recommendations if needed. My husband and I joke that we have been ruined for sushi now, this is now the bar for quality.","Jessica C.","Sacramento, CA",2023-10-01
2023-10-22,5,"What a gem! We will come here whenever we miss the wonderful meals we had in Japan. Don't let the online menu make you think the offering is limited. The rotating specials is where it's at. The menu is a solid combination of sushi and kitchen prepared meals (small bites, a few sharing dishes). Feels unfussy traditional Japanese with California flair - fresh meat/fish, quality produce, balanced flavors, and seasonal. Modern furnishing, but the overall feel is warm and inviting. No giant TVs or music blaring. Our toddlers polished off their tender pork and salmon skewers (panko breaded with sauce in the side) and miso soup. We ordered hamachi kama, okonomiyaki, chawanmushi, the dream fish roll, and nigiris for ourselves. Solid drinks menu too. Service is friendly and efficient. We shared the best hamachi kama, that's worth driving back alone to eat again, comes with crisp and sweet shredded cabbage, grated daikon, a very nicely cooked bowl of rice and miso soup that our toddlers fight over. Served with lemon and light soy sauce based sauce. Hardly used the sauce, the fish is so fresh. Slightly sweet, rich, delicate large moist flakes, and charred salted skin. I scraped the fish clean shamelessly.I have mixed feelings about having this place discovered and get too crowded in some near future. You can taste the care and precision put into these dishes; they really advertise themselves.","Sherly R.","Sacramento, CA",2023-10-01
2023-07-22,5,"The nigiri was amazing! Especially loved the golden eye snapper and scallop. Also loved the corn soup special. Cameron-San is a worthy  successor to Shige, and we can't wait to go back.","Monika R.","Manhattan, NY",2023-07-01
2023-10-05,5,"I was sad when Shige sushi closed but the new owners are great and the quality is still great! Don't let the small menu scare you away, they have two boards for specials that rotate but are fresh and high quality.","Chris-gobi J.","Hatfield, United Kingdom",2023-10-01
2023-09-07,5,"The good here is delicious! Went here with a large party. Some members were vegan/vegetarian and the owner provided them with a delicious option. The other members loved the jumbo fried shrimp and sushi. Would highly recommend!","Kate W.","Sacramento, CA",2023-09-01
2023-09-08,3,"3 all around for ambiance, service, and food. Probably a 2 for price.The ambiance is nice when you walk in, but it seems very... unfinished. Like if someone did a really good job at dressing up the inside of a doughnut store, but it still held that doughnut store vibe. Service was nice when we got it, but they we're definitely understaffed in front and back, and the waitresses looked visibly stressed. We tried a little bit of everything from the menu. The food was sort of what you would expect from a decent sushi restaurant in this area, but a little less polished (and definitely not what the restaurant's feel or brand is trying to portray).Lastly the prices. While the rolls were adequately priced, the entree's and nigiri were exceptionally expensive - for one piece of nigiri nonetheless.Overall a solid 3, especially in the context of so many other great sushi places in Sacramento.","John S.","Sacramento, CA",2023-09-01
2023-09-29,5,"I know , I know, 5 stars but its more the ambience and service and the food too! This is literary a family restaurant Cameron(sp?) the sushi chef took over from his Senpai, and crew plus family run a tight joint. Traditional japanese aged fish meaning the fish does not taste like its come straight from the fridge, more umami. He is working on his skills, give him the credit due, Sazae sashimi was awesome-its a delicacy 4 bites per 2 people! The nigiri platter was well thought out. Lots of space , bring the wee ones too ! And the skewer specials are good value for $5, @binchoyaki its $15  anyways support local business and enjoy a superior kind of sushi from someone who is really exacting and american!","Eddy B.","Phoenix, AZ",2023-09-01
2023-09-15,5,"Love this place! They have a good variety of food, the staff is happy to offer suggestions and an overall good vibe! We ate here a week ago and are back already.  Highly recommend!!","Megan M.","Seattle, WA",2023-09-01
2023-08-12,5,"Came here on a whim & we were so impressed! My husband just recently started eating raw fish and he liked the options and quality of this fish much more than any other restaurant. Not a large restaurant but very friendly staff and comfortable seating. We can't wait to come back!","Lillian T.","San Ramon, CA",2023-08-01
2023-08-19,5,"Wow, the reviews don't lie about how incredible the food here is. On par with Kru and Southpaw for sushi quality without quite as high a price tag. Yatai roll was outstanding, and their spicy tuna is the best I've ever had on the west coast. Low key ambiance and friendly service. A warning: Do NOT come here if you're in rush. It took a good 30 minutes for our three rolls to be prepared, because there's one sushi chef behind the counter and he isn't compromising on quality! Seriously though, their staff:table ratio overall is a bit lacking. No one refilled our water the entire meal. During peak rush around 7PM, we watched a couple sit down next to us and then decide to leave 15 minutes later because they still hadn't been served water or had their orders taken.We will definitely be back! But probably on a weeknight when it's a bit less crowded.","Rachel E.","San Francisco, CA",2023-08-01
2023-07-13,5,"Amazing food and service. The remodeling looks great as well.  We will always miss Shige but we're so happy a quality place went in its spot.","Monica D.","Citrus Heights, CA",2023-07-01
2023-08-29,4,"It so lil bit elegant restraunt it so nice service people and delicious food!some day I will come back again","Tara G.","Sacramento, CA",2023-08-01
2023-09-19,5,"This place is fantastic with high quality fish. Absolutely recommend if you like sushi","Lefteris S.","Carmichael, CA",2023-09-01
2023-09-30,5,"I had a big party there a couple weeks ago. The food was excellent and the fish was very high quality and fresh...comparable to Kru. The restaurant owner told me that they import fish from Japan and change the special menu often.  The service was nice and accommodating. They were so busy. The interior design is new and modern....very pleasant and cozy. I can't wait to go back to try different items with other friends and my family.","Erica L.","San Francisco, CA",2023-09-01
2023-07-25,5,"Came to this establishment with my husband and baby. Cute and cosy place. Very friendly staff, fast service, delicious sushi! Would love to go back to try their rice combo meals.","Rose R.","Santa Rosa, CA",2023-07-01
2023-08-12,5,"Fish was fresh. Service was excellent. Place was clean. I would go again.","Ken G.","Sacramento, CA",2023-08-01
2023-08-24,5,"This is authentic sushi. The quality of the fish is amazing. The menu is small but they have a large specials board that is all so good. We sat at the bar and the chefs were very nice and talkative. I recommend this place if you like real fish and not just rolls.","Makayla T.","San Luis Obispo, CA",2023-08-01
2023-07-21,5,"The best sushi we have had in the Sacramento area, and definitely top 5 we have had in CA. Very high quality fish. Pure and clean. Melts in your mouth rice. Very happy someone came to try and fill Shige's shoes. We will be back!","Greg S.","Carmichael, CA",2023-07-01
2023-07-20,4,"The food was great, as was the personable service. My only critiques are a lack of descriptions on special (there ought to be something printed that you can read at your table) & lack of sufficient air conditioning. Friends of ours went there too (at our recommendation) & their feelings were the same.We may be going again.","David W.","Orangevale, CA",2023-07-01
2023-09-28,2,"I had high hopes for this place, but it really did disappoint.  Service is slow and the space is not comfortable.  A family with a small child was asking to turn off the ceiling fan because their child was cold, but the staff was reluctant because they said it would get too hot.  We did not receive everything we ordered.  To the hostesses credit, she kindly removed it from the tab and credited my drink.  The food was good, but not worth it to endure the service and dining space.","Pamela S.","Carmichael, CA",2023-09-01
2023-07-06,5,"Been waiting for this place to open up. Worth the wait. Service was great, food was spectacular. Everything was so  fresh, nigiri would just melt in ur mouth. Definitely coming back again soon :)","Angelina R.","CA, CA",2023-07-01
2023-07-02,5,"My fiancé and I tried out this place out of curiosity as we drove passed it multiple times. My favorite parts of our order were definitely the Dream Fish and the Sashimi Mix. The fish tasted fresh and wasn't overpowered by sauces or the tempura. The owner was very passionate of his restaurant as he approached us with the sashimi and explained with pieces came from what fish. Highly recommend trying this place out!","Evonne L.","Mcclellan Gardens, North Highlands, CA",2023-07-01
2023-08-15,5,"excellent food and service. you can tell these folks truly love making excellent food","Justin J.","Fair Oaks, CA",2023-08-01
2023-08-02,5,"Absolutely outstanding food and service. A worthy successor to Shige. Fish was so fresh, glistening, and generously portioned. We'll be regulars.","CL R.","Sacramento, CA",2023-08-01
2023-09-22,3,"Something just wasn't clicking the night we went.  One sushi chef, two ladies taking orders and serving, and we saw 2 gentlemen working in the back.The place was not busy when we arrived, but then filled up right after us, with some folks waiting.We got menus and after a few minutes small glasses of water and said we were ready to order as the water was delivered.  We got the appetizer special, 1 ebi (shrimp) fry for $5.  I was sad she misunderstood and just brought us 1, but was happy later as the price was high for what we received.As it got busier we saw one couple leave because they were not acknowledged at all.It took over 30 minutes to get our drinks (sake) and another 45 to get our meals.  The table next to us came in later but got served before us.The three stars are for the sushi roll, the chicken teriyaki (large portion) and the quality of the sake.  Service was not good, and staff looked right through us (we had to aske for water refills twice) instead of letting us know they were working on our meal, or even saying sorry its taking so long.","Rob G.","East Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",2023-09-01
2023-08-17,5,"Fantastic, cozy sushi bar that uses a combo of seasonal fish and curing/aging techniques to bring out interesting flavors and textures. Definitely ask for recommendations from the nigiri board and check out the specials as there will most likely be a new food experience for you. The chefs were also accommodating and allowed me to order from the heart and request things off menu, provided they had the ingredients. Overall great experience, definitely a quality over quantity kind of place.","Nathan L.","Carmichael, CA",2023-08-01
2023-07-29,5,"Hito Yatai is simply amazing. Their fish is really fresh, they don't have an overwhelming amount of options to choose from and everything is presented beautifully. The service is excellent and everything is super nice. I keep coming back here and will continue to because this has become my favorite sushi place.","Andrew M.","Carmichael, CA",2023-07-01
2023-08-15,5,"Fantastic sushi and service, no complaints at all and will definitely visit again. Cannot recommend this place highly enough.","Dan A.","Citrus Heights, CA",2023-08-01
2023-08-03,5,"The service was great, and the sushi was superb, but we especially loved the tonkatsu!","Colleen P.","Blue Ravine Oaks, Folsom, CA",2023-08-01
2023-06-30,5,"Run, do not walk to this restaurant if you want the most authentic Japanese food in the Sacramento area.  We had an amazing omakase meal where each fish was treated with respect and in a manner to bring out the utmost in flavor and tenderness.  Such as a  creamy chawan mushi with a dashi gelee, salmon roe that is cured for 4 days ( which tastes nothing like any salmon roe I have ever had) golden eyed trout caught in Scotland, toro that was dry aged for 4 days so that it melts in your mouth; to name but a few of the several course meal.  if you like spicy California rolls ,or other named rolls with hot spice, this is not your restaurant.  If you really appreciate or want to try authentic Japanese, you will love this restaurant.  We will be back!","Lori S.","Sacramento, CA",2023-06-01
2023-07-22,5,"I've lived in New York, and Los Angeles and this place stands up to the best in those cities! The fish is absolutely amazing! Cam has a home run here! Cannot recommend this place enough!","Arthur F.","Manhattan, NY",2023-07-01
2023-07-01,5,"Superb Nigeria, amazing fish, great service, worthy successor for Shige, we're coming back soon!","John D.","Hoffman Park Bluff Estates, Carmichael, CA",2023-07-01
